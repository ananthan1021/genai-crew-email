**Notes:**

1. What is an Interpreter?

An interpreter is a program that directly executes code line by line (or statement by statement), without converting the whole program into machine code in advance.

Unlike a compiler (which translates the entire source code into machine code first), an interpreter reads, analyzes, and runs the code on the fly.

2. What is Jupyter Notebook?

Jupyter Notebook is an open-source, interactive web application that lets you:

Write and run code (Python, R, Julia, and more).

Add text/notes (with Markdown).

Visualize data (charts, plots, dashboards).

Mix everything into one document.

It runs in your browser but executes code on your local machine (or a server, like JupyterHub, Google Colab, or cloud platforms).

ðŸ”‘ The name Jupyter comes from Julia + Python + R.
